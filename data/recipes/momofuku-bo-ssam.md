Place the pork in a large shallow tray. (Roasting pan or lasagna baking dish works great!) Combine 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of the salt in a bowl and mix them well. Gently rub the mixture all over the meat. Cover it with plastic wrap then refrigerate it at least 6 hours or overnight.

When you’re ready to cook, heat the oven to 150 C / 300 F. Cover the roasting pan with cooking foil. Wrap it around at least twice covering all the gaps. (You will thank me later! This will make your cleaning process so much easier.) Remove the pork from the fridge and discard any juice. Leave the rub on the pork.Place the pork in a roasting pan (fatty side up if any), set in the oven and cook it for about 6 hours. (This can vary depending on the size of the pork. See note above for guidance.) Once cooked, the pork should be very easy to pull apart with tongs and forks. Remove the pork from the oven.

While the pork is roasting, make the salted shrimp sauce. Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and mix. Refrigerate it until needed.

Make the ssam sauce. Place all ingredients, except for the green onion, in a food processor and blend until well combined. Garnish with the green onion. Refrigerate it until needed.

Prepare other accompaniments as needed. What’s mentioned above is my recommendation, not what’s required.

Combine the remaining salt, brown sugar and vinegar in a small bowl. Mix them well. Gently rub the mixture all over the cooked pork (mainly the top of the pork). Watch out for your hands as you rub as the meat can be hot. I wore a food preparation glove for this process.Turn the oven to 260 C / 500 F (or use a grill / broiler function). Place the pork in the oven and cook it until a dark caramel crust develops on the meat. It takes 5 to 10 mins. Serve hot, with the accompaniments.
