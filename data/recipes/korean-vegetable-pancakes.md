- In a large bowl, add all the dry ingredients. Stir to combine. Pour in the cold water and whisk until combined. Be careful not to over mix. The batter will be thick.
- Add all the vegetables in and combine until well coated.
- Preheat a medium  cast iron or non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add enough oil to coat the  surface of the pan. Scoop batter, adjust amount depending on the size of our pan. It should sizzle when added.
- Working quickly, spread the batter out as thinly as possible. Cook for 4-5 minutes over medium heat. Once it's crispy and golden brown underneath, flip. Cook for 3-4 more minutes. Add more oil to the edge of the pan if needed.
- Repeat until all the batter is used up.
- Slice and enjoy immediately with Dipping sauce
